- âœ… **Safety-Critical AI**: Shows understanding of AI reliability
- âœ… **Complete Implementation**: From theory to working code
- âœ… **Professional Quality**: Clean code, proper testing, documentation

### **Interview Talking Points**
1. **Uncertainty Quantification**: "I implemented Bayesian neural networks to provide confidence estimates alongside predictions"
2. **Healthcare AI**: "I built a clinical decision support system that flags uncertain cases for human review"
3. **Technical Depth**: "I used variational inference with the reparameterization trick for scalable Bayesian learning"
4. **Practical Impact**: "The system can automatically approve 70% of cases while flagging uncertain ones for specialist review"

## ðŸ”§ **Customization Options**

### **Adjust Model Uncertainty**
```python
model = BayesianNN(
    kl_weight=1e-3,      # Higher = more regularization = more uncertainty
    num_samples=50,      # More samples = better uncertainty estimates
    hidden_dims=[256, 128, 64]  # Larger = more model capacity
)
```

### **Clinical Decision Thresholds**
```python
# In train_medical.py, adjust these thresholds:
high_confidence_threshold = 0.8    # Auto-approve above this
high_uncertainty_threshold = 0.15  # Manual review above this
```
