# Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty Estimation
## Complete Project Description

### üìã Project Summary

This project implements a comprehensive Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) system for uncertainty quantification in deep learning, with specific applications to safety-critical domains like healthcare. The implementation demonstrates how to build neural networks that provide not just predictions, but also confidence estimates, enabling safer AI deployment in high-stakes environments.

### üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional deep neural networks provide point estimates without uncertainty information. In safety-critical applications like medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, or financial trading, knowing model confidence is crucial for making informed decisions. A model that says "95% confident this is cancer" without uncertainty information is less useful than one that says "95% confident, but with high uncertainty - recommend human review."

# ELBO Loss: L = -log p(y|x,w) + Œ≤¬∑KL[q(w)||p(w)]
total_loss = likelihood_loss + kl_weight * kl_divergence

# Uncertainty estimation via multiple forward passes
predictions = [model(x) for _ in range(num_samples)]
uncertainty = torch.std(torch.stack(predictions), dim=0)
```
